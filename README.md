# EIS Data analysis using Machine Learning

Different algorithms are compared to analyze which algorithm can be used to predict the bacterial concentration in a solution using the real and imaginary impedances over a range of frequenices.

Alternatively, we can fit the equivalent circuit as determined by SVR algorithm to find out the concentration dependent parameter.
